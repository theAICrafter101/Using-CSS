# Using-CSS

By completing this project, I grasp a solid foundation on how to style HTML file using CSS properties, selectors, classes, IDs.
I learnt how to:
- link external CSS file to html head section.
- link internal CSS file with different styles in HTML head section.
- use different IDs and classes to add unique properties to the specific elements.

Following this I used how to:
- use Id and selectors
- group the selectors
- using descendant combinator
- know about the methods in CSS
- chain the different selectors
